In this demo we feed selfies into Helix and ask it to give us professional headshots. Give it a try and give us feedback on Discord!

## Steps

4. [Start a finetune session on Helix](https://app.tryhelix.ai/?mode=finetune&type=image)
   * Upload some selfies, at least five
5. Run the fine tuning
   * Prompt the finetuned image model with "A photo of <s0><s1>", you can add additional text after that prompt as well, but the "<s0><s1>" bit tells it to reference the concepts in the uploaded images
