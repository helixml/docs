In this demo I will use helix to analyse what I have written in the past year on the winder.ai website. First I will capture all of the text, then I will feed that into helix, and finally I will analyse the results.

## Steps

1. [Start an inference session on Helix](https://app.tryhelix.ai/?mode=inference&type=text)
2. Type a question relating to the user and note how incorrect it is, e.g.:
   * As of December 2023, which LLM has the largest context window size according to the table?
2. Scrape data from website. In my case, Iâ€™ve catted all the markdown into one file.
4. [Start a finetune session on Helix](https://app.tryhelix.ai/?mode=finetune&type=text)
   * Go to Helix and add this text to the fine tune section
5. When finished, re-ask some interesting questions:
   * As of December 2023, which LLM has the largest context window size according to the table?
   * Where does RL find its most effective applications?
   * What are the main topics that have been discussed in the document in 2023?
