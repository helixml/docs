* Only include data that is relevant to your problem

## Use Case Best Practices

### Question Answering

* Format training data as question-answer pairs
* Ensure your training data includes questions similar to downstream tasks
* Ensure question answer pairs have good "coverage" of your problem domain

## Inference Best Practices

* Imagine yourself performing the task or answering the question
* If you need to ask questions, then you haven't provided enough context
* If you are asking questions about a thing, indicate what the thing is
