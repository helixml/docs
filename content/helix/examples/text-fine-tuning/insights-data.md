In this demo I want to demonstrate gathering insights from your own private data. I’m going to use the content from one of the public slack channels that I enjoy, the MLOps community discussions channel. I will gather data from the past few days and then gather insights.

## Steps

1. [Start an inference session on Helix](https://app.tryhelix.ai/?mode=inference&type=text)
2. Type a question relating to the user and note how incorrect it is, e.g.:
   * What were the key discussion points in the MLOps Community Discussion slack channel today?
3. [Start a finetune session on Helix](https://app.tryhelix.ai/?mode=finetune&type=text)
   * Browse to a slack channel and copy the content
   * Go to Helix and add this text to the fine tune section
4. When finished, re-ask the same questions:
   * What were the key discussion points in the MLOps Community Discussion slack channel today?
   * What was the most common problem in the MLOps Community Discussion slack channel?
   * Generate article titles for 3 of the most interesting discussoins in the MLOps Community Discussion slack channel.
   * What should I tweet about to have a fun discussion with the people in the MLOps community?
