The natural chat interface to data prep and fine tuning workflows allows you to fine tune highly performant, optimized and small models that excel at specific tasks. This makes training your own AI accessible to everyone.

Helix is simple to integrate with: we have a simple API and you can also see what API calls to make from inside the chat app. Deploying the stack is easy with our optimized containers, deploy GPU runners with NVIDIA Docker or RunPod.
